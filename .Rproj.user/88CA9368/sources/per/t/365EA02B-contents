# EM_ForestGEO_Figure

This repository is for code I authored from my time in the ForestGEO lab at the National Zoological Conservation Biological Institute. This code was created to analyze data for a paper in the NZCBI ForestGEO lab in 2023. 

The figure represents the change in the make up of species of recruits in each quadrat from 2013 to 2023. The recruit's (young trees) species is  defined as either Canopy or Non-canopy. This is determined by the ForestGEO species ecology protocol from the ForestGEO repository. Recruits are defined as trees under 12.7 cm at standard diameter breast height (dbh), 1.3 meters.

The ratio of canopy trees to non-canopy trees is calculated from 2013 to 2023. This ratio is represented in a percentage from -100 to 100. A negative percentage shows that there are less canopy recruits than non-canopy recruits, as compared to before. A positive percentage shows that there are more canopy recruits than non-canopy recruits, as compared to before. A black square represents an absence of finalized data.

'figure 5 regeneration debt.R' has all data it needs to run in stored in the repository.

The following is the figure produced by running above referenced code:
