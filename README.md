# EM_ForestGEO_Figure

This repository is for code I authored from my time in the ForestGEO lab at the National Zoological Conservation Biological Institute.

This code was authored for a paper from the ForestGEO lab in 2023. The figure represents the change in the species of recruits, defined as trees under 12.7 cm at standard diameter breast height (dbh), in each quadrat from 2013 (the first year this census was taken) to 2023 (current year of census at writing). The recruits (young trees) species is  defined as either Canopy or Non-canopy tree. This is determined by the ForestGEO species ecology protocol from the ForestGEO repository. 

The ratio of canopy trees to non-canopy trees is calculated from 2013 to 2023. This ratio is represented in a percentage from -100 to 100. A negative percentage shows that the the ratio of recruits in the quadrat has less canopy species than before. A positive percentage shows that the ratio of recruits has more canopy species than before.

'figure 5 regeneration debt.R' has all data it needs to run in stored in the repository.

The following is the figure produced by running above referenced code:
